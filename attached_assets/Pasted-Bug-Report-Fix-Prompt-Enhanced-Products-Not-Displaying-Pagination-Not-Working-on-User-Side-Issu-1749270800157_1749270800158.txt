Bug Report & Fix Prompt: Enhanced Products Not Displaying + Pagination Not Working on User Side
Issue Summary:
Newly created enhanced products are not appearing on the user-facing Products page, and pagination is not functioning properly.

üîç Check & Troubleshoot:
1. Verify Product Fetching on User Side
Confirm that all real enhanced products are properly saved in the database.

Ensure each enhanced product:

Has status = active or is_published = true (if applicable).

Is not restricted by any admin-only flag or filter.

Check the API or controller used to fetch user-side product listings:

Is it filtering incorrectly?

Does it exclude enhanced = true by mistake?

Test whether non-enhanced products appear, but enhanced do not.

2. Fix Product Query Logic
Ensure the query fetching products on user side includes enhanced products.

Confirm there are no hard-coded filters excluding type = enhanced or similar.

If products are added recently, verify there is no cache or delay in propagation.

üìÑ Pagination Issue
Test pagination buttons (next, previous, page numbers).

Check API/controller logic handling pagination:

Verify limit and offset or page parameters are correctly passed and processed.

Confirm the frontend is rendering pagination links dynamically.

Test:

Products per page setting (e.g., 10 or 20).

Load next page and validate new results are loaded (not repeating or blank).

Ensure pagination works with both:

Mixed products (normal + enhanced)

Enhanced products alone (if filter used)

‚úÖ Expected Outcome
All real enhanced products are correctly fetched and shown on the user-side Products page.

Pagination:

Works correctly and loads correct product sets.

Supports both manual click and URL query (e.g., ?page=2).

No missing or duplicated products across pages.

üìå Additional Suggestions
Add a console log or backend log temporarily to confirm data being fetched.

Check for caching issues (Redis, frontend, or API response).

Run manual query in DB to confirm enhanced product presence and visibility flags.
