                    We work directly with carefully selected farmers who follow traditional growing methods. All products undergo multiple quality checks before reaching you, ensuring exceptional flavor and purity. Our team regularly visits farms to verify practices and maintain our high standards.

                    Many of our partner farms follow organic practices but don't always have formal certification due to cost constraints. We personally verify all farming methods to ensure they meet our standards for chemical-free production. Products with official organic certification are clearly labeled on our website.

                    Storage instructions vary by product type. Fresh produce is best kept refrigerated, while dried goods should be stored in cool, dry places away from direct sunlight. Each product page provides specific storage recommendations, and we include storage guidance with your delivery.
